Before deciding to believe a person, thoroughly think about three criteria:<br>
(1) Once upon a time, he or she talked with you about a thing, crying or feeling painful.<br>
(2) Never is he or she late, leaves early, break an appointment at last minute.<br>
(3) He or she never speaks ill of others when being with you.<br>
